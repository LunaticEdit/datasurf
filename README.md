# DataSurf
Moving data at the speed of win!



## What is this?
It's a data movement platform designed to facilitate processing of data from sources, and moving the output into destinations of various types. The intended audience is similar to that of Oracle ICS, Jitterbit, and other ETL style applications.

The focus is on ease of use, proper administration and project/source control, as well as maintenance and analytics.

This project is still in early development and is not currently in a state fit for use of any kind.
